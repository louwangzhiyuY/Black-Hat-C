# Black-Hat-C
I really enjoyed the book Black Hat Python by Justin Seitz. This book inspired me to port existing code into C. Of course when dealing with target systems, languages supported by the target vary (Although Python Is Generally Used). For this reason I decided to start this project.The original book can be purchased here: https://www.nostarch.com/blackhatpython . I would also like to note these tools are meant to be used when all other resources are not available. Consider all these snippets quick and dirty.
