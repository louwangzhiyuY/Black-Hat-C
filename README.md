# Black-Hat-C
I really enjoyed the book Black Hat Python by Justin Seitz. This book inspired me to port existing code into C. The original book is not only a great read, but can even be used as a reference when writing python programs to be used offensively.  Of course when dealing with target systems, languages supported by the target vary (Although Python Is Generally Used). For this reason I decided to start this project. The original book is a must have for anyone looking to program with python in an offensive way. The original book can be purchased here: https://www.nostarch.com/blackhatpython
